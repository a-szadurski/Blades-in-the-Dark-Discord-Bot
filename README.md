# Blades-in-the-Dark-Discord-Bot
My first attempt at creating a discord bot, to help me and my friends play RPG tabletop games remotely. To demonstrate the functionalities, I will be using a single RPG system, Blades in the Dark, and implement its mechanics into the app.  
The first hurdle is to learn how to communicate with the API, which might take me a bit.
